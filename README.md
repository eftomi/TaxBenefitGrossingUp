# TaxBenefitGrossingUp

Package allows for gross personal income estimation (GrossIncome[]) for individual on the basis of net personal income and relevant personal income tax (PIT) parameters such as tax allowances, PIT schedule, tax credit system and social security contributions. Besides this, package exposes NetIncome[] function as a GrossIncome[] reverse. Primary goal of the package is to enable data imputation of gross personal income in microdatabases used in macroeconomic simulations where gross personal income computation is not trivial.
